# CHANGELOG

## Version: 2.1.3

##### Published: 24.07.2021

1. Alignment animation size changes:

- "padding" size is not longer calculated based on the wrapper size - it's now
  represented by pixels
- you can set separate "padding" values for X and Y

2. Storybook docs fix - prevented to log every action callback since it was
   killing performance
